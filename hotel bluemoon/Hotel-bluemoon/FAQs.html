              All rates on the website are per room per stay, unless stated differently.<br><br>



              <strong>Do I pay a reservation fee?</strong><br><br>

              <strong>Can I use discount vouchers (e.g. issued by magazines, shops, etc.)?</strong><br><br>

        <h3>Credit Card and Payment</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <div class="content-inner">
            <p><strong>Why do you need my credit card details?</strong><br><br>


              In general your credit card details are only required as a guarantee for the hotel in case you don't arrive or cancel too late. This might result in a "no-show" charge (generally the equivalent to one night stay) by the hotel. We will never charge your credit card. You will pay for your stay at the hotel.<br><br>



              <strong>Does the hotel need a deposit or a payment in advance?</strong><br><br>


              You will pay for your stay at the hotel. If the hotel requires a deposit, it will be clearly mentioned on the overview page of the hotel. However, note that some hotels perform a pre-authorization check on your credit card as an extra guarantee. A pre–authorization is a validity check to reserve a certain amount that would guarantee the room. This amount may correspond to the price of one night or to the total costs of your reservation. Once the credit card has been validated, the reserved amount will be released.<br><br>



              <strong>What types of credit card can I use to guarantee the reservation?</strong><br><br>


              MasterCard, Visa and American Express are accepted as a guarantee. However, it is possible that the hotel does not accept all of these for payment. Please check at the bottom of the overview page of the hotel the “Hotel Policies” section for ‘Accepted credit cards.’<br><br>



              <strong>Can I pay for my stay in advance?</strong><br><br>


              Please note that such arrangements depend on each hotel’s policy. Therefore, you will need to contact the hotel directly. The hotel’s contact details can be found in the confirmation e-mail of your reservation.<br><br>



              <strong>Can I pay for my stay at the hotel with a different credit card than the one used to guarantee the reservation?</strong><br><br>


              As the credit card details are only needed for guarantee purposes, you can pay at the hotel using the method of payment of your choice.<br><br>



              <strong>My credit card has been charged. How can I get a refund?</strong><br><br>


              We never charge our guests’ credit cards. The charge has been performed by the hotel. Therefore, you will need to contact the hotel directly. The hotel’s contact details can be found in the confirmation e-mail of your reservation.<br><br>



              <strong>I do not have a credit card. Can I still book a room?</strong><br><br>


              Unfortunately all hotels require a credit card to guarantee a reservation. We are not able to process any reservation without a credit card.<br><br>



              <strong>Is it safe to fill in my credit card number? How secure is the your website?</strong><br><br>


              Your credit card information is sent to us through a secure server. We use the latest, most secure technology available, which encrypts all your personal and credit card details. The encryption method used is the industry standard "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) technology. Our SSL certificate has been issued by Thawte.We also use a firewall which protects our servers and network against unauthorized access. In the unlikely event that your credit card were to be misused, we promise to reimburse you the first 50 Euros on the cost. The credit card is obliged to pay the remainder.</p>
